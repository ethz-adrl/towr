## Question or Issue?
* [ROS Answers](https://answers.ros.org/questions/ask/):
  If you want to ask a general usage question, please do this at ROS Answers using the tag `towr`. Asking there has the following advantages:

  - There are many more people reading questions there so your chances on getting an answer and in a timely manner are much   higher.
  - In the future other users will search there for similar problems and can find your question and the potential answers.

* [Issue tracker](https://github.com/ethz-adrl/towr/issues):
  In case you want to report bugs, request features or anything more related to code than to usage, the 
  Issue tracker in this repo is the way to go.   


## How Can I Contribute?
Unsure where to begin contributing to towr? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Good first issues](https://github.com/ethz-adrl/towr/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/ethz-adrl/towr/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Further ideas might include:
- add cool terrains/height-maps
- add different robot models
- enhance the user interface
- add additional constraints
- include cost terms to smooth out solutions
- improve performance
- reporting bugs
- enhance documentation
- add more unit tests

Please follow the [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) when writing your C++ Code for this project. 


## Submitting a pull request
Please create a [pull request](https://github.com/ethz-adrl/towr/compare) from your forked repo to the master branch.
