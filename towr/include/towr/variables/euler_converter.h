 * @brief Converts Euler angles and derivatives to angular quantities.
 *
 * Euler angles, their first derivatives (Euler rates) and their second
 * derivatives fully define the angular state of an rigid body in space. This
 * class provides equivalent formulation of these values, specifically:
 * @li Orientation as Rotation matrix or Quaternion.
 * @li Angular velocity (x,y,z)
 * @li Angular acceleration (x,y,z)
 *
 * Furthermore, the Euler angle spline is fully defined by a set of node values.
 * This class also gives the derivative of the above quantities with respect
 * to the values of these nodes.
