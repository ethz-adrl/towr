 * @brief Dynamics model relating forces to base accelerations.
 *
 * This class implements a Single Rigid Body dynamics model, a reduced
 * dimensional model, lying in terms of accuracy between a Linear
 * Inverted Pendulum model and a full Centroidal or Rigid-body-dynamics model.
 *
 * This model makes the assumption that the motion of the limbs does not
 * incur significant momentum and can therefore be neglected. This eliminates
 * the nonlinear dependency on joint angles and allows to express
 * all quantities in Cartesian space.
 *
 * For the derivation and all assumptions of this model, see:
 * https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000272432
