 * ### Add your own robot
 * To add your own robot, you must create its KinematicModel and DynamicModel.
 * The kinematics simply define a workspace for each end-effector. The
 * Dynamic Model can be everything from a Linear Inverted Pendulum,
 * SingleRigidBodyDynamics (SRBD), Centroidal Dynamics to Full-Rigid-Body
 * Dynamics (RBD). This library provides an implementation for the
 * SingleRigidBodyDynamics in which only the combined mass and inertia must
 * be adapted, but other models can be used as well. For example robots
 * to use as a guideline, see \ref include/towr/models/examples.
