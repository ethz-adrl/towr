/**
 * @brief The parameters to tune the optimization problem.
 *
 * The number of parameters to tune is relatively small (~10), however, they
 * do have a large impact on speed and convergence of the optimizer. Below
 * we give some insights into how different values affect the solution and
 * what should be taken into consideration when tuning these. For more
 * background knowledge, refer to the corresponding
 * [paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2018.2798285).
 *
 * #### Towr problem formulation
 * \image html towr_problem_with_code.png
 *
 * ### Constraint discretization ###
 * A factor that strongly impacts the solution time is how
 * often the DynamicConstraint and the RangeOfMotionConstraint are enforced
 * along the trajectory (given by the values of @ref dt_constraint_dynamic_
 * and @ref dt_constraint_range_of_motion_). Increasing the discretization
 * interval of e.g. @ref dt_constraint_range_of_motion_ to 1.5s greatly speeds
 * up the process. However, if the discretization is too coarse, the motion
 * of e.g. the endeffector can move way outside the bounding boxes, as long it
 * comes back inside this box at the few times the constraint is actually
 * enforced. This is a valid solution to the optimization problem, but of
 * course physically infeasible. Therefore, when the solution shows the
 * feet shooting quickly through 3D space, @ref dt_constraint_range_of_motion_
 * should probably be decreased. The same logic holds for too large
 * @ref dt_constraint_dynamic_: This can produce motion that violate the
 * dynamics at most times, except exactly where they are enforced. This leads
 * to unphysical motions that will be impossible to track on a real system. The
 * more finely the constraint discretization is set, the more sure one can be
 * that the dynamic model is being respected.
 *
 * ### Number of optimization variables ###
 * In order to shorten the solution time, another way is to use less
 * polynomials, but each of longer duration. This can be achieved by increasing the
 * @ref duration_base_polynomial_. However, the longer this duration becomes, the
 * less parameters (freedom), the solver has to find a solution that
 * fullfills all the constraints, so it becomes more likely that no solution
 * is found. This variable is related to @ref dt_constraint_dynamic_ --
 * if the dynamic constraint should be enforced at very short intervals,
 * it is often also required that the base motion has enough freedom (short
 * durations) to enable this.
 *
 * ### Available steps ###
 * One of the main reasons that the solver **fails to find a solution**, is when
 * there are are not enough steps available to reach a goal position that is
 * either too far away, or the terrain too complex. The number of steps per leg
 * and their initial durations are set by @ref ee_phase_durations_. On the other
 * hand, too many steps per leg are hardly an issue and the solver simply
 * generates more short steps, but finds a solution nonetheless. Therefore:
 *   * push back more phases for each foot into this vector to give the
 *     optimizer more freedom in finding a solution.
 *
 * ### Jittering (and cost terms) ###
 * Sometimes the solution to the optimization problem looks jerky, with the
 * forces and base motion quickly jittering back and forth. This is because
 * by default, we don't include any @ref costs_ in the formulation. The solver
 * has too many optimization variables (degrees of freedom) to modify and only
 * few constraints that restrict the motion, so these extra and unnecessary
 * values can be set to extreme values. The cleanest way to counter this
 * is to add a cost term that e.g. penalizes base and endeffector accelerations.
 * See @ref Costs for some inspiration. We try to avoid cost terms if possible,
 * as they require tuning different weighing parameters w.r.t. each other and
 * make the problem slower. Other ways to remove the jittering are as follows:
 *   * Increase @ref duration_base_polynomial_ to remove some DoF.
 *   * Decrease the overall time-horizon of the optimization problem. This is
 *     determined by the sum of all elements in @ref ee_phase_durations_. A
 *     shorter time horizon means less base polynomials, therefore less
 *     extra degrees of freedom for the optimizer to set to extreme values.
 *   * Decrease @ref force_polynomials_per_stance_phase_ to have less jittering
 *     force profiles and therefore also less jittering base-motions.
 *
 * ### Optimizing the gait ###
 * The solver is able to modify the gait to best achieve a given task. This
 * can be turned on by calling OptimizePhaseDurations(). This can help the
 * solver find a solution to terrains which cannot be crossed with the
 * initialized gait. However, this optimization over the phase
 * durations, which affect the entire motion of that endeffector, reduce the
 * sparsity of the formulation. This increases the chances of getting stuck
 * in local minima, as well as increases the computation time. Therefore,
 * this option should be treated with caution. An alternative to turning on
 * this option is initializing with different gaits and/or changing the
 * parameters described above.
